## Open Source projects

You can find my open source projects on both Github ([https://github.com/FunkMonkey](https://github.com/FunkMonkey)) and 
Gitlab ([https://gitlab.com/adaptive-learning-engine/vle](https://gitlab.com/adaptive-learning-engine/vle)).

Most of the projects on GitHub are quite dated (with the exception of `pl-ml-experiments`). The adlete-vle / KIWI 
project on GitLab is from my final project at HTW Berlin, which I am continuing to develop in my free time.

## Coming soon

- Project fact sheets (employers may have already received these as part of my supplementary materials)
